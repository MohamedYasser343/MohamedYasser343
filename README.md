## About Me
I’m a Delivery Consultant at Monglish International Academy specializing in full-stack development, systems integration, and systems analysis. I partner with stakeholders to translate business needs into technical solutions, oversee integrations across platforms, and ensure smooth delivery from design through deployment. I focus on maintainable code, delivery automation, and system reliability to help teams move faster with reduced risk.

I’m also a Software Engineer studying Computer Science at Egypt-Japan University of Science & Technology (E-JUST), with a strong interest in systems programming, application security, and building secure, scalable software systems. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean code, solid architecture, and a deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware and networks.
