## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a deep interest in building secure, scalable, and efficient software systems. I study Computer Science at Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST), where I specialize in software development, systems programming, and application security.

My engineering journey spans building system-level tools, secure applications, and full-stack solutions, often integrating cybersecurity best practices to enhance software reliability. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through clean code, solid architecture, and a deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware and networks.
